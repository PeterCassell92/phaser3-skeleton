# phaser3-skeleton
phaser 3 skeleton project structure and a summary of the tips I have found for optimising workspace for Phaser.


WORKSPACE
Concencus online is to use Visual Studio Code (VSC) or Sublime Text 3. I have opted to use VSC because it is possible to use intellisense for Phaser on this. (Phaser 2 had a sublime intellisense plugin but Phaser 3 does not yet)

ACTION 	- Install VSC then open VSC
	- Click on extensions button
	- Search for and Install Live Server

TEST	- Open the /main folder in VSC. (this is effectively your working directory)
	- go to index.html, right click on the editor and click "Open with Live Server"
	- now check that whenever you make any changes to your files that the page updates automatically.

	- Now go to /main/src/init.js and on a blank line type "game." . You will see that Phaser 3 intellisense options appear.
